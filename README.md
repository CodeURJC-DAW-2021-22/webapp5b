# Softwear

Online clothing store web app. We sell our own products, made with the highest quality fabrics and cloths, as well as the best brands on the market. We promote reducing clothing waste, so everything on sale is guaranteed to last more than two years, thus fighting climate change.

Based on minimalistic design bringing user experience upfront.

We provide a catalog that can be filtered through different categories, allowing users to access all products intuitively with ease. Furthermore, users can save a wish list for future transactions. Once the shopping cart is done, a checkout may be fullfilled.

*Phase 3
![class_diagram](readmeAssets/class_diagram_phase3.png)

## Algorithms

Our app tracks the least favorite products and calculates a discount for them based on their popularity ranking and a minimum price every product has.

## Graphs

Our graph is a bar plot located at the admin panel and allows admins to track the volume of sales and their respective earnings.

## Extra technologies

We've implemented a mail function that sends the user a mail when they make a purchase with the product summary, price and transaction number for posible incidence.

## Tools

## Heroku

Url: https://codeurjc-daw-2021-22-webapp5.herokuapp.com/

User credentials: 

* admin:pass
* user:pass


### Heroku Deployment

In order to deploy the application with heroku, you must create a heroku account and install heroku and docker clients.

First, you need to log in and create a new application with the following commands:

```bash
heroku login
heroku create <app-id>
```

Then, you need to pull our application image from DockerHub for pushing it into the heroku repository:

```bash
docker image pull softwearDAW/codeurjc-daw-2021-22-webapp5
```

You need to log in heroku repository and push the downloaded application image into your application repository. You could do it with the following commands:

```bash
# Log in heroku repository
heroku container:login
# Change image name
docker image tag softweardaw/codeurjc-daw-2021-22-webapp5:latest registry.heroku.com/<app-id>/web:latest
# Push image
docker push registry.heroku.com/<app-id>/web
```

Then you need to configure the database. You can add the database to your heroku app running the following command:

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql --app <app-id>
```

You need to set the environment variables running the following command:

```bash
heroku config:set \
	SERVER_SSL_ENABLED=false \
	SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL-AUTO=update \
	MAILER_EMAIL=<mailer-email> \
	MAILER_PASS=<mailer-pass> \
	--app <app-id>
```

Finally, you could release the application running the following command:

```bash
heroku container:release web --app <app-id>
```

---

You could destroy the application running the following command:

```bash
heroku apps:destroy --app <app-id>
```


## Docker

### Application Execution - Docker Compose

You need to install the docker client and docker-compose. You would use the docker-compose.yml file in the docker directory.

You need to specify an email for your mail service. If you don't, the application's mail service will not work. You should specify it in a environment variable named MAILER_EMAIL.

You need to do the same in order to specify the service's password. It is set in the variable MAILER_PASS.

You could execute the following command in order to set those variables and run the application:

```bash
# If you have a docker-compose version previous to version 2, you should use the command docker-compose up

env MAILER_EMAIL=<your-mailer-email> MAILER_PASS=<your-mailer-pass> docker compose up
```

### Build the image

In order to build the image with the executable file you sould change your wd to docker directory and execute:

```bash
./create_image.sh
```

You need to install docker in your system in order to execute this script. Also, you may need execute it as root.

## Api REST documentation

* [OpenApi JSON](https://github.com/CodeURJC-DAW-2021-22/webapp5/blob/main/api-docs/api-docs.json)
* [OpenApi HTML](https://rawcdn.githack.com/CodeURJC-DAW-2021-22/webapp5/0becb842fc6f969684dcde3be654949e32f543b6/api-docs/api-docs.html)
	

## Development environment

When working in the development environment, backend and frontend will be initialised separately and will communicate with each other via REST api. In order to do it, we set a proxy which let frontend to get all needed information from backend. It's configuration is in proxy.conf.json.

### Launch angular aplication

```bash
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```
or 
```bash
npm start 
```
We can use this comand because it was configure as a script in package.json.

### Launch spring-boot aplication

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Changes in docker image construction

Added in dockerfile code needed to build angular before maven to move it later.
